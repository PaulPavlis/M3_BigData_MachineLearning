We link the NYC citibike tripdata with daily weather observations.
The weather data consists of one row per day which includes observations such as: min/max/mean temperature, precipitation, min/max/mean wind, etc.

– Which stations were most popular (starts/ends)?
    - Is the operator of citibike required to evenly distribute the bikes?
	- At which stations is the number of trip-ends higher than the number of trip-starts?
– Development of trips over the year?
– Stations/trips that are popular in summer/winter...during morning/at night?
– Outliers/stations especially popular during a specific day (event)?
– Other interesting patterns found?
– Find correlations with weather conditions:
    - min/max/mean temperature
	- precipitation
	- wind speed
	- season
