# Using this project

## Important: Since github decided my lfs space is not enough, the data can be found at: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Akm5cFGjLfsviOBMlDX97-TNY55ugQ?e=R4B7YS

If you want to work with the full amont of data, you need to install git lfs (large file storage). Follow the instructions at:

```
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage
```

Depending when you install lfs, you might need to download the lfs data separately from the rest of the project. This is done by doing:

```
git lfs pull
```

For just using a random sample of the data, this is not required

### Optional: Adding or updating files to git lfs
